In this project a linear regression model was built to predict the values of PM2.5 .Independent variables effecting the PM2.5 values were PM10,SO2,CO,NO2.
Missing values were replaced wit ffill and bfill
Higher values more than 400 for PM2.5 were replaced with monthly mean
The target variable PM2.5 is right skewed .Transforming by cube root  was also tried
But the predicted values didnt match the historical data
